          >This was my project for my Design Thinking and Innovation module in
          term 2. The purpose of the project was to improve social cohesion in
          the aftermath of the COVID virus by recreating one of the structures
          in the Changi Business Park area. My team consisted of a mix of people
          who were software orientated, systems oriented, and me who was
          engineering orientated. After going through the double diamond design
          process to facilitate idea selection and refinement, we decided on
          building a shelter structure that opens up when people are near, and
          produces other effects such as rotating, music, and lights with more
          people.</text

          >Floom is a flower structure that opens up when there is a person
          nearby. When there is more than one person, it starts playing music
          and starts the light show at night. This attracts people nearby and
          improves social cohesion.</text

        <text
          >The main mechanism to open up the flower lies in the origami
          mechanism in the 'stem'. The rotation of the motor at the bottom of
          the structure is directly transferred through the 'stem' to the top of
          the flower to open up the flower. I produced the structure in Rhino
          (for aesthetics) and SolidWorks (for simulation). The mechanism was
          also constructed physically using paper.</text

          >Initially, I wanted each layer to contain 8 sides to ensure stability
          and cut fabrication costs. However, after calculating the geometry of
          the structure, I found out that for the angle we used, the shape would
          be impossible and the minimum number of sides in order to have the
          structure would be 9 sides. Thus, we have to update the design.
          Eventually, being the engineer within the team I produced a 1:8 scaled
          down version of the structure, with the rotation and light mechanisms
          within.</text
