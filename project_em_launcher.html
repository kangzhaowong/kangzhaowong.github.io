          >For my Technological World module in term 2, my team was tasked to
          produce a prototype that made use of electromagnetism. Thus we decided
          on producing an electromagnetic launcher.</text

          >It was quite early on that our team realized that this was a
          difficult prototype to produce. Although conceptually it seems simple,
          the hard part came about when we had to control when to cut the power
          to the electromagnet. Too fast and the projectile does not gain enough
          velocity. Too slow and the projectile gets stuck within the coils,
          oscillating back to the center. It was by luck that we discovered
          another method of launching the projectile that was not constrained by
          the tight requirements of the conventional electromagnetic
          launcher.<br /><br />Between one of our tests, we decided to replace
          the small piece of iron with small magnets in the coil, hoping that it
          would increase the distance we can launch the projectile. However,
          these small magnets started rotating once the electromagnet was
          switched on, resulting in several failed attempts. Thus, we attached
          the magnetic to both sides of the iron piece to ensure the magnets do
          not rotate. This did not help much as the extra mass meant the iron
          piece could not travel as far. It was during one of these tests that
          we were surprised when one of the magnets was launched extremely fast
          out of the barrel. Compared to previous tests where the projectiles
          were launched around 10 to 15 cm high, this specific test went more
          than 50 cm. It was only after multiple tries to recreate the
          conditions that it happened and theorizing that we managed to come up
          with a theory of how it occurred and how to reproduce it.</text

          >Our electromagnetic launcher does not work like conventional
          electromagnetic launchers. Conventional electromagnetic launchers work
          by attracting the iron piece to move forward and switching off the
          field when the iron piece is almost out. Our electromagnetic launcher
          does not work like conventional electromagnetic launchers. The
          electromagnet induces a magnetic field in the iron piece, turning the
          iron piece into an electromagnet. The magnets attached to the iron
          piece are orientated in a way such that it opposes the poles of this
          new electromagnet. The force of repulsion from the electromagnet and
          the magnets result in the magnet being expelled from the coil. The
          electromagnet does not need to be switched off immediately as when the
          magnet exits the coil, the pole of the magnet is still repelling the
          magnetic coil, resulting in further repulsion. The reason we used
          magnets on either end was that we realized if we ensured the magnet on
          the back end locked in place, the force of repulsion from the magnet
          at the back is transferred to the magnet at the front through the iron
          piece, resulting in even faster launch velocities. When this occurred
          we were able to shoot the magnet up to 1.1m high.</text

          >However, in the end we were only able to calculate and predict
          empirically how fast we can launch the magnet and were not able to
          figure out the formulas for the repulsion of the magnet as we did not
          know how to calculate the force of repulsion that was generated when
          the two magnets were touching. Even so, we can predict that although
          this method was able to launch projectiles very quickly without much
          stringency on time, the projectiles need to have their own magnetic
          field. Rare earth magnets are not the best choice for these
          applications as every time they are launched they will experience a
          sudden change in magnetic field in the opposite direction. The result
          of this would be it being demagnetised extremely quickly. As such,
          electromagnets should also be used for the projectile. This means
          higher power consumption but the electromagnets only need to be on for
          a short while from the start to after it exits the coil.</text
