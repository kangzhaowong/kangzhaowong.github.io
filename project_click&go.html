          >For my Engineering Design Innovation module in Term 4, my Team was
          tasked to produce a product with the theme of travel. After research
          on what constitutes travel and the problems associated with it, using
          a Pugh chart, we chose the problems cyclists face. We then researched
          more specifically on our chosen topic and conducted surveys to
          understand their point of view. Through our surveys, it showed that
          reducing time to lock, ability to adapt to a wide range of
          infrastructure, and security were most desired (in that order of
          importance).</text

          >We set our design statement to be: How may we make the locking and
          unlocking of bicycles to infrastructure fast and seamless? As such, we
          used these to form our goals to meet for our final product, a bicycle
          lock. Once the goals were set, we started developing multiple ideas
          and decided on the best idea to go ahead with using another Pugh
          chart. We split the work into mechanical (includes simulations,
          composite), electrical (includes PCB fabrication, simulation),
          software (includes UI/UX, app development, database). We modeled and
          simulated our locking mechanism, developed and tested mechanical
          prototypes of the model, using 3d printing before fabricating the
          actual product. We fabricated and tested each of the electrical
          components to check if they will be able to meet the required goals. I
          had 2 roles in this project, I was in charge of the fabrication and
          testing of the carbon-fiber shell that protected the bicycle lock and
          software of the product.<br /><br />Due to prior experience in
          fabricating composites, and the help of my team members we were able
          to produce samples of the Carbon-fiber epoxy composite that I
          performed flexural, tensile, and compressive tests using ASTM
          standards. Using the material properties obtained from these tests, we
          were able to simulate the properties of our bicycle lock under
          different loading and impact. We also fabricated the actual shells
          using the same process.</text

          >For the software side, we wanted an app that was able to alert the
          owner if the bicycle was being stolen, have the ability to add or
          remove bikes, check on the status of the battery of the bicycle, 2FA
          authentication, was able to provide life tracking of the location of
          al their bicycles, show distance to the bicycle, lock and unlock the
          bicycle remotely through the internet or close range through
          Bluetooth, and pair with the physical electronic key. I used unity for
          the main app and their gps functionality, Firebase for the database, I
          also used a free component that was able to open load a browser in the
          app. The actual interface of the app was designed with html and
          JavaScript, which I used Leaflet to generate the map. This was because
          eventually I would like to turn this into a web application.</text

          >However, in the end we were only able to calculate and predict
          empirically how fast we can launch the magnet and were not able to
          figure out the formulas for the repulsion of the magnet as we did not
          know how to calculate the force of repulsion that was generated when
          the two magnets were touching. Even so, we can predict that although
          this method was able to launch projectiles very quickly without much
          stringency on time, the projectiles need to have their own magnetic
          field. Rare earth magnets are not the best choice for these
          applications as every time they are launched they will experience a
          sudden change in magnetic field in the opposite direction. The result
          of this would be it being demagnetised extremely quickly. As such,
          electromagnets should also be used for the projectile. This means
          higher power consumption but the electromagnets only need to be on for
          a short while from the start to after it exits the coil.</text

          Best Prototype by Singapore University of Technology & Design and
          highest graded project within our cohort as we had demonstrated the
          use of actual materials, components, programs and software and
          delivered a finished product with high detail.</text
