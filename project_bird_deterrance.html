          >For my Electromagnetics & Applications module in term 5, my team
          produced a loop antenna that was able to disrupt the navigation
          abilities of birds to prevent them from eating unattended food at our
          school canteen and defecating everywhere. Through our research, we
          realized that birds have magneto-receptors in their beaks that contain
          iron which respond to magnetic fields. This is a bio-magnetic compass
          that responds to magnetic fields and provides directional or
          quantitative information. By application of EM waves at specific
          frequencies, we can disrupt the magnetic field and affect their sense
          of direction, leading them away from our canteen. From our research,
          these frequencies are mostly in the range of 0.1 to 10 MHz.
          Controlling the mini VNA with our laptop, the desired 7 Mhz is
          generated to ensure our antenna can meet one of the researched
          specifications. To cover a wide range of birds and research scopes,
          the mini VNA is then used to sweep across a range of 1 - 10 Mhz.
          Before fabricating the antenna, we simulated the device using CST
          Studio Suite to check if it could produce the frequencies that we
          desired.</text

          >The magnetic loop antenna consists of a main loop and a coupling loop
          to produce 6.2 MHz. Air variable capacitor connected to the coupling
          loop is made to tune the operating frequency. This forms an effective
          LC circuit to transmit magnetic waves. The air capacitor was a
          butterfly capacitor fabricated by us. This is because at high voltage,
          dielectrics may break down and thus we decided to use air as the
          dielectric instead.</text

          >The device was tested with a spectral analyzer to check if it was
          able to produce the desired frequency in the range. At 1 m away, we
          were able to observe the peak at 6.20 MHz which was within the range
          that we stipulated. We also tested the device outside, where we place
          food near the antenna and switch it on for a period of 30 minutes. The
          test was successful as no birds approached the food even though they
          were in the area.</text
